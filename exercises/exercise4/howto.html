            <b>Introduction to Texas Hold'em:</b>Texas Hold'em is the most widely played variant of poker and serves as an excellent starting point for new players. In this game, players receive two private cards (hole cards), and five community cards are placed face-up on the table. The objective is to form the best hand using any combination of these seven cards.
